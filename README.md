Dummy database creation

This project demonstrates my proficiency in writing SELECT queries (DQL) and CREATE TABLE statements (DDL) for a relational database. I designed an ERD to model a simple schema. Using a RDBMS, I created the tables with DDL statements and inserted dummy data. The focus is on writing SELECT statements to query and retrieve data from the single or joined tables, including filtering, sorting, aggregating, and analyzing the dummy data. Overall, this project showcases my ability to create database tables using DDL, and then query the database using basic to intermediate SELECT statements (DQL).
